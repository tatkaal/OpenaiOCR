# Atelier-Scrapper Installation Guide

## 🚨 **If Double-Click Doesn't Work**

Sometimes Mac security settings prevent double-clicking `.command` files. Here are **3 easy alternatives**:

### **Method 1: Right-Click Method** ⭐ **EASIEST**
1. **Right-click** on `Double-Click-to-Install.command`
2. **Choose:** "Open With" → "Terminal"
3. **Allow** if Mac asks for permission
4. **Wait** for installation to complete

### **Method 2: Terminal Method**
1. **Open Terminal** (search "Terminal" in Spotlight)
2. **Type:** `cd ` (with a space after cd)
3. **Drag** the Frankie folder into the Terminal window
4. **Press Enter**
5. **Type:** `bash install_and_run.sh`
6. **Press Enter**

### **Method 3: Fix Permissions First**
1. **Open Terminal**
2. **Navigate to the Frankie folder** (drag and drop method above)
3. **Type:** `chmod +x *.command *.sh`
4. **Press Enter**
5. **Now double-click** `Double-Click-to-Install.command`

## 🔒 **Why This Happens**

**Mac Security:** macOS sometimes removes execute permissions from downloaded files for security.

**The Fix:** Our installer now automatically fixes this! But if it still doesn't work, use Method 1 above.

## ✅ **Once Installation Works:**

No matter which method you use, the result is the same:
- ✅ Everything installs automatically
- ✅ App opens in your browser
- ✅ Enter your OpenAI API key
- ✅ Start processing images!

## 📞 **Still Having Problems?**

**Check these:**
- ✅ All files are in the same folder
- ✅ You have internet connection
- ✅ You're using macOS (this is Mac-only)

**If nothing works:**
1. Try restarting your Mac
2. Re-download the complete Frankie folder
3. Use Method 2 (Terminal method) above

**The app will work perfectly once installed - this is just a one-time setup step!** 🚀
